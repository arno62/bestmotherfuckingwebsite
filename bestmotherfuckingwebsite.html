  <h1>This is the <em>best</em> motherfucking website.</h1>

  <p> Really, it is.</p>

  <h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>

  <p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <a class="rat">motherfuckingwebsite(.com)</a> is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>

  <p><a class="rat"><U>WRONG</U></a>, motherfucker.</p>

  <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>

  <p>Let me describe the <i>real</i> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <a class="rat">motherfuckingwebsites</a>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
    <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://google.com/"><a  style="color:#2598A6;"><U>Google home page</U></a></li>
    <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
    <li>Looks <i>almost</i> the same on every screen</li>
    <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <small>well, kind of</small></li>
    <li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"><a.  style="color:#2598A6;">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <small>but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</small></li>
    <li>Shit is <i>even more</i> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET"><a  style="color:#2598A6;"><U>ARPANET</U></a> website</li>
    <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers"><a  style="color:#2598A6;"><U>IPoAC</U></a></li>
    <li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" <small>which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</small></li>
    <li>Doesn't include any tracking service <small>this website does, but hey, who cares</small></li>
    <li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <i>JUST USE IT</i>.</li>
    <li>Use <i>some</i> fucking colors.</li>
    <li>Links don't really need to keep that <a style="color:#2537A6;">shitty blue</a> the browser is giving them: nor that violetish color when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa"><a  style="color:#2598A6;"><U>nice color</U></a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>

  <p>
    This website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com"><a  style="color:#A6256F;"><U>guy</U></a> and the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"><a  style="color:#A6256F;"><U>guy before him</U></a>.</p>
    <p>
      Why?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS"><a style="color:#2598A6;"><U>secure connection</U></a> - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
        <li>It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gTLD"><a style="color:#2598A6;"><U>gTLDs</U></a> available out there: .website</li>
  <li>It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="http://domainr.com/"><a  style="color:#2598A6;"><U>domainr</U></a> to do something cool too.</li>
  <li>It uses the kickass <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><a  style="color:#A6256F;"><U>Let's Encrypt</U></a> CA (don't you see the gorgeous lock?)</li>
  <li>It runs on <a href="https://nginx.com/"><a style="color:#2598A6;">nginx</a>: the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server</li>
  <li>It doesn't use a single media query <small>well, not really</small></li>
  <li>It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from <a href="https://microsoft.com/ie"><a style="color:#2598A6;"><U>the crap he uses</U></a> to <a href="https://mozilla.com/firefox"><a style="color:#2598A6;"><U>a much cooler browser</U></a></li>
  <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5 </li>
  <li>It supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2"><a style="color:#2598A6;"><U>HTTP/2</U></a></li>
  <li>It uses <a href="https://piwik.org/"><a style="color:#2598A6;"><U>Piwik</U></a>, a free and Open Source analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us)</li><li>It allows universal access from every website via <a href="https://enable-cors.org/"><a style="color:#2598A6;"><U>CORS</U></a></li>
  <li>It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php"><a style="color:#2598A6;"><U>Accessible</U></a></li>
  <li>It's Open Source, freely available on <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/"><a style="color:#2598A6;"><U>Github</U></a>, and everybody can contribute to it.</li>
  <li>It uses the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/"><a style="color:#2598A6;"></U>WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</U></a>, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:

   <a class="tot"> 0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</a></li></p>

</ul>

<h2>Put even less contrast</h2>

<p>Yeah, a #444 is cool but a #454545 is better.</p>

<p>We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a.</p>

<h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>

<p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either.</p>

<h2>Put some pictures</h2>


<a class="rou"><img {  src="azz.gif"
  width : 100px;  
  vertical-align:middle;
}

  <p style="line-height:65px;"><a class="rou">We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a <a class="rat">motherfuckingwebsite </a> so include some pictures to give a context.</p>

  <p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p>

  <p>You see that fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.</p></a

<h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>

<p>But this doesn't mean you should load your <a class="rat">motherfuckingwebsite</a> with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users, <less>requests (with a small size) = faster load time!</less></p>


</blockquote>Good design is as little design as possible. Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com</blockquote>

<p>That's not entirely true, look at that <a class="rat">motherfuckingwebsite</a>. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <a class="rat"href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"><u><a class="rat">motherfucking</u></a> and the <u><a class="rat"href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"><a class="rat">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</u></a>.</p><p>Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even though this is still <a class="rat">thebestmotherfuckingwebsite</a>), so go check 'em out.</p>

<p>Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again" Cit. needed</p>

by <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/aloiswohlfahrt-123449/"><a style="color:#2598A6;"><U>aloiswohlfahrt</U></a>,
but I had to change it, cause it was too heavy and too cute.
